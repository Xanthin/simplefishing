Just the fishing and sealife feature from the ethereal mod:

for a simple and multiplayer working fishing and seaplants.

Note: rename the folder into "fishing", but actual the textures are missing here, so better use the uploaded file in the forum.
If you want only fishing or only the seaplants, comment out the corresponding dofile in the init.lua file.
